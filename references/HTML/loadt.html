<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Finds a file on the load path and loads it.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN> takes a string indicating an OCaml file name as
argument and loads it. If the filename is relative, it is found on the load
path <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>load_path</SPAN>, and it is then loaded, updating the list of loaded files.

Additional paths can be added to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>load_path</SPAN> by setting the
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>HOLLIGHT_LOAD_PATH</SPAN> environment variable. Each path must be separated by
an OS-specific delimiter (':' for Unix and ';' for Windows).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN> will fail if the file named by the argument does not exist in
the search path. It will of course fail if the file is not a valid OCaml
file. Failure in the OCaml file will also terminate loading.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
If we have an ML file called <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>foo.ml</SPAN> on the load path, e.g. in the current
directory, which contains the line
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   let x=2+2;;
</PRE></DIV>
this can be loaded as follows:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   # loadt "foo.ml";;
</PRE></DIV>
and the system would respond with:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # loadt "foo.ml";;
  val x : int = 4
  val it : unit = ()
</PRE></DIV>
